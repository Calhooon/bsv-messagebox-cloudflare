# Changelog

All notable changes to the relay. Public releases are cut from this repository with
`scripts/release-public.sh` (Cloudflare resource identifiers scrubbed) into
`Calhooon/bsv-messagebox-cloudflare`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-02

### Transport
- **Engine.IO SERVER heartbeat** (`EngineIoSession`): a Durable Object alarm armed at the
  `5` upgrade commit sends `2` every `pingInterval` (25 s); the client's `3` clears it; a ping
  unanswered past `pingTimeout` (20 s) closes the socket (`ping timeout`), exactly as the
  reference socket.io server behaves. The heartbeat state lives on the WebSocket attachment,
  so it is correct after hibernation, and the alarm disarms when the last socket closes.
  Before this the handshake advertised the interval and the server never pinged: every
  browser socket died 45 s after its upgrade and fell back to HTTP long-polling (measured on
  LOW: 354 long-poll frames in 37 minutes for one idle client).
- Socket.IO session TTL honours `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (was hardcoded 1 h) with lazy
  touch-on-traffic; the traffic-path touch fires on real `authMessage` generals.
- WS `sendMessage` acks and broadcasts on the recipient's room (official-client parity);
  duplicate WS acks are SUCCESS, not `messageFailed` (killed a 10 s send stall).
- The DO→MessageHub forward hop and the best-effort WS push are bounded and retried, so a
  wedged Durable Object can no longer hang `/sendMessage`.

### Rooms, presence, fan-out
- Public broadcast rooms (`broadcast-*` boxes) with a subscriber registry sharded by identity
  nibble (16 DOs, parallel reads) and a bearer-gated `POST /broadcast` fan-out.
- Join hello: one delivery-shaped frame to the joining socket (proves the socket to clients
  that are HTTP-first until a delivered frame).
- `peerLeft` when an identity's last session leaves a room, also on raw socket drop
  (`websocket_error` runs the same departure teardown); the push is debounced ~4 s behind a
  trailing occupancy re-check, with every stranded pending-left path closed.
- `GET /presence` returns an optional advisory `lastSeenMs`; the stayer publishes its real
  rejoin deadline; a hub fault is reported as a fault, never as an absence.

### Storage and reliability
- Transcripts retained until terminal for opt-in box classes (`/listTranscript`,
  `/purgeTranscript`).
- D1 write path bounded and retried; the remaining unguarded D1 writes guarded; the
  `find_message_box` read bounded; the transient D1 cold-start error on the first request
  retried.
- Per-recipient send context batched into one D1 round-trip.
- Uniform CORS on every response; lazy, non-fatal session touch (no 429 / CORS-less 500).
- `bsv-middleware-cloudflare` 0.3.2 (KV transient retry on the hot auth path); the dead
  path-patch that silently pinned 0.2.0 removed.

### Operations
- `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` env var; a dedicated per-deployment config file pattern
  (`wrangler.<deployment>.toml`, private) with an isolated beta environment (own D1/KV/R2).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-05-26
- `listMessages` bounded (`LIST_MESSAGES_LIMIT`) to prevent the 128 MB Worker OOM.
